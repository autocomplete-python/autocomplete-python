    pythonPaths:

      title: 'Python Executable Paths'
      description: '''Optional semicolon separated list of paths to python
      executables (including executable names), where the first one will take
      higher priority over the last one. By default autocomplete-python will
      automatically look for virtual environments inside of your project and
      try to use them as well as try to find global python executable. If you
      use this config, automatic lookup will have lowest priority.
      Use `$PROJECT` or `$PROJECT_NAME` substitution for project-specific
      paths to point on executables in virtual environments.
      For example:
      `/Users/name/.virtualenvs/$PROJECT_NAME/bin/python;$PROJECT/venv/bin/python3;/usr/bin/python`.
      Such config will fall back on `/usr/bin/python` for projects not presented
      with same name in `.virtualenvs` and without `venv` folder inside of one
      of project folders.
      If you are using python3 executable while coding for python2 you will get
      python2 completions for some built-ins.'''

      include for autocomplete. You can use same substitutions as in
      `Python Executable Paths`.
      Note that it still should be valid python package.
      For example:
      `$PROJECT/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages`
      or
      `/User/name/.virtualenvs/$PROJECT_NAME/lib/python2.7/site-packages`.
      You don't need to specify extra paths for libraries installed with python
